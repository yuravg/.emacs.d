My emacs setup is tested to work only with emacs 25.1 and newer
versions. If you are on older versions, I would recommend that you
upgrade to the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html][latest available stable version]].

On the other hand, I keep my emacs updated to the [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/log/][/latest Development
version/]]. So my config will definitely work with that if you too are
doing the same.

* Using my emacs setup
You can start using my emacs setup by following these steps:

1. Download the latest update script for this config
   #+begin_src shell
   curl -o force_update_emacsd.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/.emacs.d/master/force_update_emacsd.sh
   chmod 744 force_update_emacsd.sh
   #+end_src
   This script /git clones/ my config and all sub-modules that I rely
   on (mine + others).
2. Run the script (review it first if you like) using below if you
   want to download this config to your =~/.emacs.d/= directory.
   #+begin_example
   ./force_update_emacsd.sh ~/.emacs.d
   #+end_example
   /If the download location you specify already exists, a backup of
   it is created first./
3. *Edit the =user-emacs-directory= var in the just downloaded
   =init.el= if needed BEFORE starting emacs using this config.*

   If you ran =./force_update_emacsd.sh ~/.emacs.d= in Step 2 above,
   you will not need to change that variable. But if you did
   =./force_update_emacsd.sh <MY-EMACSD-DIR>=, you will need to change
   the value of =user-emacs-directory= in =<MY-EMACSD-DIR>/init.el= to
   =<MY-EMACSD-DIR>=.
4. Start emacs as usual if you did not change the download location in
   Step 2. If you DID change the download location to
   =<MY-EMACSD-DIR>=, you will need to do =\emacs -Q -l
   <MY-EMACSD-DIR>/init.el=.

That's it!

The first start will take a couple of minutes as it auto-installs all
packages in the =my-packages= list defined in the =init.el=.
* Few notes
- Few setup files have setup done as per my personal tastes and needs:
  - =setup-files/setup-misc.el=
  - =setup-files/setup-mode-line.el=
  - =setup-files/setup-registers.el=
- If you want to change the default theme, font size, etc, you would
  want to edit =setup-files/setup-visual.el=
- Any of the variables or global minor modes set in my config can be
  overridden in =setup-personal.el= which you need to create in the
  directory pointed by the variable =user-personal-directory=.
- You can also choose to override certain variables in the very
  beginning of the =init.el= by customizing the variables in a
  =setup-var-overrides.el= file placed in
  =user-personal-directory=. You can refer to an example of this file
  [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/.emacs.d/blob/master/personal/setup-var-overrides-EXAMPLE.el][here]]. During the first time setup, copy the
  =setup-var-overrides-EXAMPLE.el= file to =setup-var-overrides.el= in
  the same directory.
- =setup-editing.el= has interesting elisp snippets that I created +
  borrowed over time for functions related to general editing.
* Key points
- Use of my minor mode =modi-mode= to enable my custom
  key-bindings. Doing so allows me to force override my bindings in
  all major and minor modes. If I ever need to try out the default
  emacs bindings, I can simply disable =modi-mode= by doing =M-x
  modi-mode=. /It is enabled globally by default./
- Use of =use-package= in load all packages for faster load times.
- Use of =bind-keys= allows me to review my custom bindings in a
  single buffer by doing =M-x describe-personal-keybindings=.
- Certain packages will be loaded only if you have the associated
  applications installed.
