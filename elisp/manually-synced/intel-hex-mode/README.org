This is an Emacs major mode for working with Intel Hex files (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX).

Features:
 - Allows easy updating of checksums
 - Provides font-locking
 - Uses the mode line to show addresses and field types
 - Detects and uses easymenu if available

To use intel-hex-mode, add
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(load-file "PATH_TO_FILE/intel-hex-mode.el")
#+END_SRC
to your =~/.emacs(.el)=

By default, this mode is enabled for files with a .a90, .hex, .a43, or .ihx extension.

Use =C-c C-c= to update the current lineâ€™s checksum, and =C-c C-b= to update the whole buffer.
