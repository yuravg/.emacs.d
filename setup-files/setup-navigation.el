MODE (defaults to value of `major-mode') is a symbol used to look up
string syntax parameters in `ffap-string-at-point-mode-alist'.

If MODE is not found, we use `file' instead of MODE.

If the region is active,return a string from the region.

If the point is in a comment, ensure that the returned string does not contain
the comment start characters (especially for major modes that have '//' as
comment start characters).

;; Follow-mode is a minor mode that makes 2 or more windows, all showing the same
;; buffer/file, scroll as a single tall virtual window. To use Follow mode, go
;; to a frame with just one window, split it into two side-by-side windows using
;; C-x 3, and then type M-x follow-mode. From then on, you can edit the buffer
;; in either of the windows, or scroll either one; the other window follows it.
;; In Follow mode, if you move point outside the portion visible in one window
;; and into the portion visible in the other window, that selects the other
;; window again, treating the two as if they were parts of one large window.
