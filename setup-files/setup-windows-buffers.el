;; When multiple buffers are visible (like in a frame with 2 or more windows),
;; do not display an already visible buffer when switching to next/previous
;; buffers or after killing buffers.

;; (setq recenter-positions '(0.50 0.07 0.93))
;; First C-l  -> 0.50: Put point vertically at the middle of the window
;; Second C-l -> 0.07: Put point close to the top of the window. If
;;                     (window-height) returns 70, that's roughly 4 lines.
;; Third C-l  -> 0.93: Put point close to the bottom of the window ~ 3 lines.
;; With the default values of `recenter-positions' and `scroll-margin' (0),
;; the "top" position is the first line of the window, and the "bottom"
;; position is the last line. Above settings provides a margin of 3 or 4 lines

;; (1) `C-l'
;; C-l calls the `recenter-top-bottom' command. But typing C-l twice in a row
;; scrolls the window so that point is on the topmost screen line.  Typing a
;; third C-l scrolls the window so that point is on the bottom-most screen
;; line. Each successive C-l cycles through these three positions.
